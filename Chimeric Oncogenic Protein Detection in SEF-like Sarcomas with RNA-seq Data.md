### Description:

This project investigates an unusual mechanism by which a portion of the KMT2A gene inserts into the YAP1 gene, resulting in the oncogenic fusion protein YAP1::KMT2A::YAP1 (YKY). Using RNA-seq data from sarcoma samples, bioinformatics pipelines were developed to identify, validate, and analyze fusion events and their downstream effects on gene expression. The analysis leveraged tools like STAR-Fusion, FusionCatcher, and ChimeraScan to detect fusions and understand their potential role in oncogenesis through pathway enrichment and differential gene expression.

### Bioinformatic Skills Demonstrated

	1.	RNA-Seq Data Analysis:
	    •	Alignment of RNA-seq reads to the reference genome.
	    •	Quality control and filtering of reads from FFPE and fresh frozen tissue samples.
	2.	Fusion Gene Detection:
	    •	Identification of fusion events using STAR-Fusion, FusionCatcher, and ChimeraScan.
	    •	Validation of detected fusions with additional RT-PCR data.
	3.	Differential Gene Expression:
	    •	Quantification and differential expression analysis with RSEM and DESeq2.
	    •	Pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to identify upregulated pathways and signaling mechanisms (e.g., Hedgehog, Wnt).
	4.	Data Processing & Management:
	    •	Scripting for large-scale data processing using SLURM for job scheduling and parallelization.
	    •	Automation of file renaming, merging, and directory management for organized project handling.
